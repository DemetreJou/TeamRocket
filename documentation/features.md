## Features

### High-level features for A2

Our main goal for the new features is to create an application where we implement a simple logging system. Therefore, we are able to meet the following criteria:

- Understand and experiment with log messages - correlation id, context id, etc.
- This logging system would allow one machine to log multiple inputs from various servers.
- Begin with a single endpoint that reads and writes to our PSQL database from our logging system.
- Have a simple “dummy” page on the web browser that presents relevant information

In order to achieve that, we created the following tasks:

- Creation of an application that generates logs on a single machine.
  - Delegated to: Demetre Jouras
  - Due: October 31st
- Creation of a class that would allow us to connect to the central log database.
  - Delegated to: Sultan Sidhu
  - Due: October 31st
- Setting up the networking layer that transports the logs to the database.
  - Delegated to: Demetre Jouras
  - Due: October 31st
- Deployment (AWS, Heroku, etc) and CI/CD expansion - add tests + linter + code metrics
  - Delegated to: Abhi Kapoor
  - Due: October 31st
- Basic log visualization - have a server that supports getting information from the database for a given machine
  - Delegated to: Gazi Jarin
  - Due: October 31st
- Creation of a class that does actual logging logic.
  - Delegated to: Sultan Sidhu
  - Due: October 31st
- Creating artifacts of documentation
  - Delegated to: Gazi Jarin
  - Due: October 28th
